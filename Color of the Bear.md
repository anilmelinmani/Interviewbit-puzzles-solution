## Question:

A Bear has fallen from a height of 10m from ground. It reached ground in sqrt(2) seconds. Luckily it didn’t get hurt. What color is the bear?

## Solution Approach:

Calculating g, it comes as 10, which means the bear is found where there is more gravity. 
The gravity is increased at the poles. and the South pole doesn’t have bears ( http://sciencequestionswithchris.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/do-i-weigh-less-on-the-equator-than-at-the-north-pole/ ).

So the bear being referred to comes from North Pole. Hence, its white.

One of the craziest questions I came across :P
